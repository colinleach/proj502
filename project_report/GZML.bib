	abstract = {We present the data release for Galaxy Zoo 2 (GZ2), a citizen science project with more than 16 million morphological classifications of 304,122 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Morphology is a powerful probe for quantifying a galaxy's dynamical history; however, automatic classifications of morphology (either by computer analysis of images or by using other physical parameters as proxies) still have drawbacks when compared to visual inspection. The large number of images available in current surveys makes visual inspection of each galaxy impractical for individual astronomers. GZ2 uses classifications from volunteer citizen scientists to measure morphologies for all galaxies in the DR7 Legacy survey with m\_r{\textgreater}17, in addition to deeper images from SDSS Stripe 82. While the original Galaxy Zoo project identified galaxies as early-types, late-types, or mergers, GZ2 measures finer morphological features. These include bars, bulges, and the shapes of edge-on disks, as well as quantifying the relative strengths of galactic bulges and spiral arms. This paper presents the full public data release for the project, including measures of accuracy and bias. The majority ({\textgreater}90\%) of GZ2 classifications agree with those made by professional astronomers, especially for morphological T-types, strong bars, and arm curvature. Both the raw and reduced data products can be obtained in electronic format at http://data.galaxyzoo.org .},

Note that not all posteriors/vote fractions are relevant for every galaxy; we suggest assessing relevance using the estimated fraction of volunteers that would have been asked each question. We include a schema document, schema.md, to define the column names in each catalogue. We also release the galaxy images shown to volunteers on www.galaxyzoo.org during GZD-5. The images on which the automated classifier was trained may be derived from these volunteer-facing images. These images are split into four zip files, each of which contains images named by iauname inside a subfolder named by the first four characters in their iauname. Not all images were labelled during GZD-5 - refer to the catalog for training labels. We are working with the Zenodo team to add these large files to this repository - meanwhile, you can download them from The University of Manchester here. The .csv and .parquet files contain identical data. Parquet is a fast column-oriented binary format which can be read with pd.read\_parquet(loc, columns=[some columns]). You may also be interested in the github repository which contains code to reproduce the model and to fine-tune it for new tasks (including pretrained weights). We will release updates if needed via Zenodo versioning. We recommend using the latest version of this repository. You can check the version you are currently viewing on the right-hand sidebar. Please cite the paper (DOI to follow on publication) when using the data in this repository. --- History v0.0.1 (submission) provides the catalog files. v0.0.2 (first revision) renames the catalog files, adds flags for poorly sized galaxies, and includes the galaxy images via the University of Manchester},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            We present Galaxy Zoo DECaLS: detailed visual morphological classifications for Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey images of galaxies within the SDSS DR8 footprint. Deeper DECaLS images (r = 23.6 versus r = 22.2 from SDSS) reveal spiral arms, weak bars, and tidal features not previously visible in SDSS imaging. To best exploit the greater depth of DECaLS images, volunteers select from a new set of answers designed to improve our sensitivity to mergers and bars. Galaxy Zoo volunteers provide 7.5 million individual classifications over 314 000 galaxies. 140 000 galaxies receive at least 30 classifications, sufficient to accurately measure detailed morphology like bars, and the remainder receive approximately 5. All classifications are used to train an ensemble of Bayesian convolutional neural networks (a state-of-the-art deep learning method) to predict posteriors for the detailed morphology of all 314 000 galaxies. We use active learning to focus our volunteer effort on the galaxies which, if labelled, would be most informative for training our ensemble. When measured against confident volunteer classifications, the trained networks are approximately 99 per cent accurate on every question. Morphology is a fundamental feature of every galaxy; our human and machine classifications are an accurate and detailed resource for understanding how galaxies evolve.},
